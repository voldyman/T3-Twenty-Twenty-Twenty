# T3 - Twenty Twenty Twenty 

Take breaks from staring at a screen every **20** minutes by looking at least **20** meters away for **20** seconds.

### Why?

I got corrective eye surgery and the doctor recommended taking breaks, setting timers is too painful and i wanted to learn Electron+javascript.

### What Next?

- [ ] Don't show interstitial when Zoom/Chime are open
- [ ] Handle locked screen
  - [ ] don't notify when the screen is locked
  - [ ] don't count the time when the screen was locked
- [ ] Make the parameters configurable
